# How is my work today?
- Im using tmux and nvim
- I have already some projects and others new that do not exist in my machine yet, so these both workflows need to be covered
- I open in one session, a lot of cc panes and also others to see logs and code and other stuffs
- my ctrl b s is very bad, i do not like the way tmux show me the sessions opened by default
- and i do not have a quick way to move between sessions from keyboard and neither a way to see what is happening in each session (like maybe a semantic layer could be nice, using cc headless to read a conversation and generate a summary for me, using haiku model)

# What i would like to accomplish?
- Be very fast managing this way of work
- Be more productive and do not lost track of the work
- To also be able to extract the most out of this workflow, i need to improve in planing my tasks. And, would like to be prompted on the start of my workflow which tasks i will solve this sprint, and have a centralized way to read this tasks.
- In summary what i want:
    - Make context switching esier
    - Sharpinig my tools for that
    - Planing more about my tasks

If we could create a framework to go through all these 3 points, may a TUI on top of tmux, or something just configured... I dont know, i need you to help me on this.
